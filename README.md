Rock paper scissors is a hand game originating from China, usually played between two opponents, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are `rock`, `paper` and `scissors`.

A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a **draw**, a **win** or a **loss**. 
A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). 
If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied.
