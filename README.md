# The "Rock - Paper - Scissors" Game

Rock paper scissors is a hand game originating from China, usually played between two oponents, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock", "paper" and "scissors".

A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. 
A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). 
If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied.
